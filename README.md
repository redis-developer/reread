# reread

Desktop based or Self-hosted RSS feed reader.

## Motivation

The motivation to develop `reread` came from my own personal itch. I have 100s of feeds
that I follow but no service currently allows to add all of them in a single free account.

* Feedly limits to 100 sources in free plan
* InoReader is limited to 150 sources
* NewsBlur is limited to 64 sources
* FeedSpot has no search in free plan
* Winds has very limited capabilities

As I read about the Redis Hackathon I thought it would be a good idea to develop something
that I can use in future as well. And thus was born `reread`.

## Improvement items

* Improve performance on OPML import - MasterFeed check takes a lot of time
* Allow users to selectively import from OPML
